I have added a guestbook to this site that allows you to leave little messages [here](https://harljo.uk/guestbook/). I do have some rules that I require every poster to abide by or their message would be removed from the guestbook.

* Don't spread malware or spam
* Don't spread hate
* Don't spread personal infomation about others
* **Use** your common sense
* Be *kind*

**Messages added to the guestbook cannot be removed after posting**
